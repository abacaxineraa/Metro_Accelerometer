# Measuring the Acceleration of the Montreal Metro using an Arduino Train Accelerometer​

Our goal was to collect data on the acceleration experienced in the Montréal metro. We used an Arduino electronic circuit to power an accelerometer within a box we place on the metro for this purpose. We look at vibration levels, maximal acceleration, and maximal deceleration as comparisons between different lines and train types.​ The questions answered by this project are ones that we naturally asked ourselves when taking the metro every day getting to school, and we finally found a creative way to answer them. The poster attached presents our findings in further detail.
